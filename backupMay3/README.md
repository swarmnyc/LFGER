SWARMsecret
===========================
Your friendly neighborhood anonymous tweet web app. 

Simply connect a Twitter account through OAuth in config.php. Then create a "Feed Widget" from you account, and import the data-widget-id into pullme.php, deploy, and let anyone on the internet tweet from it anonymously. Super fun at parties. Give it a spin at http://swarmnyc.com/experiments/swarm-secret-anonymous-twitter/

For our other experiments head to http://swarmnyc.com/expriments 

<h2>INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
<p>1. Set up config.php</p>
<p>2. Set up pullme.php</p>

Deploy & tweet anonymously. 

ALSO: You can set up kickback.php to auto include content in these anon-tweets but we'd love it if you kept the twitter mention.

Enjoy!!!!! 

<h2>NOTES:</h2> 

This was put together for funsies, there are bugs, namely mobile CSS issues I didn't feel like fixing, if anyone would like to take care of those it'd be butter. 

Also, the code isn't spectacular, but hey. It works.
